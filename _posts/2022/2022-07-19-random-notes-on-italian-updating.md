## Noun groups

Position of adjectives (1.4.5, 40.7.1)

The adjectives in Italian are usually placed after the noun, since this is the usual non-emphatic position occupied by the adjective. The position of the adjectives is flexible unlike in English, but the change of position can change the emphasis of the sentence, or even the meaning of the adjectives. For example, _nuovo_, _vecchio_, _giovane_, _piccolo_, _bello_, _brutto_, etc. specify or distinguish the noun from other objects when placed after the noun, and are meant to describe the noun with some emphasis or imagination when placed before the noun.

## Verbs

The subject-verb order can be inverted due to the complete enough verb conjugation system. The choice of the order depends on the emphasis, such as what is called "topicalisation". (40.7)

Choice of the auxiliary verb in the compound tenses (2.1)

Generally Italian transitive verbs use the auxiliary _avere_, while (purely) intransitive verbs use the auxiliary _essere_ (with some exceptions _camminare_, _dormire_, _giocare_, _passeggiare_, _piangere_, _riposare_, _viaggiare_, which use _avere_). For those verbs that can be used both transitively and intransitively, the choice of _avere/essere_ is more a matter of personal choice and linguistic habit (usually _avere_ I would say). In fact, the most common intransitive verbs in daily life are those describing movements, and they can almost never be used transitively.

Of course, the reflexive forms always use _essere_ as the auxiliary.

Some usages of the reflexive form (2.1.7)

The reflexive form marks basically a reflexive or reciprocal action, but there are more interesting usages of it in Italian such as follows

- To stress the subjective side of an event, the importance of this event to the person (the self) who is involved in it and who is its (grammatical) subject, e.g. _Ho fame! Voglio mangiar**mi** una piazza!_ "I'm hungry! I **really** want a pizza!" Apparently, such a reflexive pronoun could be removed.
- The pronoun _si_ can be used to express the impersonal form of verbs (the subject is some unspecified person or thing which is translated in English as "one"), e.g. _Stasera si va a ballare._ "Tonight one/everyone is going to dance."

Some usages of the imperfect (2.3.6, 23.2.2)

- To refer to the "future in the past", instead of using the past conditional (30.5.2), e.g. _Mia mamma mi aveva promesso che veniva/sarebbe venuta a trovarmi ieri sera_.
- To express a polite request or a statement in place of the present conditional, e.g. _Volevo/vorrei delle rose._
- In improbable hypothetical clauses (spoken form): _Se + IMPERFETTO, IMPERFETTO._ Its written form should be Se + CONGIUNTIVO IMPERFETTO, CONDIZIONALE PASSATO.

Simple perfect (2.3.8)

In spoken Italian, the simple perfect tends to be used very seldom in the north of Italy, but quite often in Tuscany, and in central and southern Italy, in the contexts where we want to express the distance of past events, not just in time, but mainly in terms of their separateness or remoteness from the present.

Conditional mood (2.3.11)

The conditional is sometimes used to convey the message in the press where it is important to stress that the opinion is subjective and not proved. (27.1.4)

Different moods for reporting information or quoting hearsay: indicative to show objectivity, conditional and subjunctive to show uncertainty or subjectivity. This is very systematic and the use of the latter two really depends exclusively on the certainty and/or objectivity that we want to convey and emphasise. (31.4)

Subjunctive mood (2.3.14)

As one could imagine, the subjunctive mood is mainly used to express something that is uncertain rather than definite, subjective rather than objective, or a concept rather than a reality.

Its most common use is in expressions of doubt, hope or supposition, and is always linked by _che_ to corresponding expressions, e.g. _Speriamo che_... Its use is almost the same as in Spanish. However, good news for French speakers/leaners! Because in Italian there is no more need to distinguish between two cases _sperare_ "espérer" and _desiderare_ "souhaiter": they both require the subjunctive in Italian since they all express hope.

_Che + CONGIUNTIVO_ can be used to express purpose, and also implies that the speaker is looking for a type of person or object, not one specific one know to him or her. A more formal way is to use _per fare + INFINITIVO_, even more formal is _perché + CONGIUNTIVO_. (33.3.2)

Curiously as follows are some uses of the imperfect subjunctive (2.3.19, 38.3.1):

- To express a condition unlikely to be met.
- When the main verb is in the present conditional, for a present or future action depending on it we use the imperfect subjunctive, e.g. _Vorrei che voi parlaste con il capo._

Imperative: instead imperative forms (2.3.22), one uses the infinitive form while writing instructions, to convey a sense of impersonality both for the source (often an unnamed authority or expert) and for the target reader (the general public). (21.4)

Negative imperative (2.3.24)

One just adds _non_ to the imperative, except in the case of the 2nd person singular, where one uses _Non + INFINITIVO_.

### Past participle agreement (2.3.28)

We cite a (rather complete) set of rules:

> L'accordo del participio passato è:
> 
> \- obbligatorio, quando questo è costituito dai pronomi diretti atoni di terza persona lo, la, li, le e con ne: ho visto dei libri interessanti e li ho comprati; devo comprare una camicia; ne ho viste alcune molto belle;
> 
> \- facoltativo, ma abbastanza diffuso, con i pronomi atoni oggetto non di terza persona:Marco ci ha salutati (o ci ha salutato); scusatemi, non vi avevo visti (o non vi avevo visto);
> 
> \- raro (e caratteristico di un registro letterario o elevato) quando il complemento oggetto non è un pronome atono (ho mangiata una mela). Questo tipo di accordo è appena più frequente quando l'oggetto è costituito dal pronome relativo che (i libri che ti ho regalati).
> 
> Pietro Trifone e Massimo Palermo, _Grammatica italiana di base_.

One more rule (3.4.7): _ne_ replacing a partitive noun direct object also counts as a direct object pronoun, so agrees with the past participle in gender and number.

In particular the past participle in a subordinate clause in Italian and in Spanish does not have to agree with the relative pronoun in front of it, but it does so in French.

### Accent of verbs

Italian sounds rhythmic partly due to its regular accent rules: if you constantly read Italian words with accent on the penult then you would sound like an Italian! Of course, this is not such easy. Here are my observations (gradually adding exceptions):

- Put aside the one-syllable words.
- If there is an accent mark, that is where the true accent falls.
- For words with at least two syllables, put an accent on the penult.
- Unfortunately there are many exceptions (noun and adjectives) with an accent on the antepenult: _macchina_, _telefono_, _\-evole_ "-able", etc.
- Enclitics do not change the accent of the belonging word (usually a verb).
- Verbs
    - The infinitive, gerund and participles have accent on the penult.
    - The future, various past tenses and the conditional have accent on the first syllable of the suffix, e.g. _\-ai_, _\-avo_, the same in **all the 1st and 2nd person plural** cases.
    - What remains is the present in the singular or the 3rd person plural. Usually they are accented on the last syllable of the root (penult for the singular, and antepenult for the 3rd person plural), but with a few verbs such as _telefon_are, _ordinare_, _capitare_ where the accent moves one syllable further (I do not know why).

## Pronouns

**Relative pronouns**

_Cui_ (3.5.2) is the relative pronouns used with the function of indirect object or other complement of the verb, and is usually preceded by a preposition _a_, _con_, _da_, _di_, etc. Another use of _cui_ is (relative) possessive adjective (so still requires a definite article before it), like the English "whose", e.g. _la persona **le cui** chiavi sono rimaste sul mio tavolo_.

The relative pronoun _Chi_ (3.5.4) can also be used as a double pronoun, meaning _quello che, uno che_ "the person who". This is not the case of the French "qui", but rather should be translated as "celui qui", etc. Neither is it the case of the Spanish "que", instead one should say "aquello que".

The possessive adjective is usually placed before the noun. When it follows the noun, it carries a strongly emphatic or emotional meaning, e.g. _Mamma mia!_ (3.7.2)

proprio own (3.7.2)

Demonstratives: questo, codesto (far away from the speaker but near to the person addressed), quello. Other demonstrative pronouns _ciò_, _costui/costei/costoro, colui/colei/coloro_. (3.8.2)

## Prepositions and adverbs

Remember there are combined prepositions (with definite articles). (4.2)

On can use both _a_ or _per_ to express the purpose, but with verbs expressing movement such as _andare_, _venire_, _correre_, there is a choice of using _a_ or _per_ after them: whereas _a_ tends to focus on where you are going, _per_ has more of a sense of purpose and indicates for what reason you are going there. (33.2)

While _per + INFINITIVO_ can be used to express the purpose, so can _da + INFINITIVO_, but to express the passive sense "to be done". (33.4.2)

_A/e_ "and/" before vowels becomes _ad/ed_. (4.3.1, 5.2.1)

Adverbs (and prepositions) expressing place (37.2, 37.3): _davanti≠dietro_, _dentro≠fuori_, _lontano≠vicino_, _sopra≠sotto_; _su≠giù_ "up/down", _in alto≠in basso_, _a sinistra≠a destra_, _in centro_, _in fondo_ "at the bottom, in the background"; _a_, _in_, _per_, _su_, _verso_ "towards", _da + PERSONA_ "to"; _da_ "from", less frequently _di_; _a_, _da_, _in_ "in, at".

Exceptions those without definite articles: _a casa_, _a scuola_, _a teatro_.

_Alla + AGGETTIVO FEMMINILE_, for example in cooking, can be used to indicate manner. (37.4.2)

Adverbial adjective is an adjective used with the force of an adverb, which is becoming more and more common, for example, in advertising language. It is used in the masculine singular form, e.g. _parlare chiaro_ instead of _chiaramente_. (37.4.3)

Different degrees of bene "well" can be formed with suffixes _\-ino_, _\-one_: _benino_ "quite well", _benone_ "very well". (37.4.5)

Some unusual adverbial form include those ending in _\-oni_ which apply mainly to physical actions such as _gattoni_ "catlike". (37.4.5)

Weights and measures: _costare €10 (dieci euro) l'uno/al chilo/all'ora_ "cost 10 euros each/per kilo/per hour". (7.9)

Nationality: no capital letter is used for adjectives of nationalities. (8.3.5)

Marital status: "single" is best expressed in spoken Italian as _non sposato_. In the media, however, the English _single_ is often used; in more formal contexts, _celibe_, _nubile_ are often used. (8.3.6)

Place of origin: _essere di_, _venire da_. (8.3.8)

Doubling the adjective can intensify its meaning. (10.4.5)

Describing a physical state: _essere_ is used to ask about physical appearance, while _stare_ is used to ask about state of health. (10.6)

Expressing "some": _qualche_ is always used with the singular form of nouns despite its plural meaning, it can only be used with countable nouns. By contrast, _alcuni/alcune_ can be used with countable nouns but always in the plural. For both countable and uncountable nouns, one can use the partitive articles (the same in form as _di + ARTICOLO DETERMINATIVO_). (11.6)

The _passato remoto_ is used much less frequently than the _passato prossimo_. One main difference is that the use of the former indicates the disconnection of the action from the present. For example, when talking about Dante, one could use the _passato remoto_ to simply describe his experiences, but could also use the _passato prossimo_ to write about his influence on today, all depending on the view chosen from which one hopes to express. (13.2)

Expressing "since": when the event in question is still going on, one uses the present tense with _da + TEMPO_, otherwise one uses for example the perfect tense with _per + TEMPO_. (13.7.1)

Expressing "ago": use _INTERVALLO DI TEMPO + fa_. (13.8.1)

Expressing "last...": use _scorso_ or _passato_ (the latter only comes after the noun), e.g. _la scorsa settimana_, _il mese scorso_, _l'anno passato_, _l'estate passata_. (13.8.1)

Asking about things: _Che cosa...?_ "What...?" In a more informal way, one may use simply _che_ or _cosa_. (15.3.1)

When _niente_ (and less common _nulla_) comes first in the sentence, the _non_ is not needed (similarly as in Spanish, not as in French where "ne" appears in every negative sentences). (16.5)

Expressing "than": usually, one uses _di_ when comparing nouns, pronouns or adverbs of time or place, otherwise uses _che_. However, when comparing adverbs of time or place, one always uses _che_ if the adverbs are next to each other, e.g. _...oggi che ieri_. (17.3)

Sometimes we want to focus on the action rather than on the person carrying out the action. The most naive way is to use the passive construction (19.2): to the past participle, one can add

- _essere_,
- _venire_, to express a passive action (rather than a static state),
- _andare_, to indicate how things should be done.

The second one is rather formal.

Or one can use the _si passivante_ or the _si impersonale_, depending on whether the verb is transitive or intransitive.

## Simple communication

Some formal greetings (20.2, 20.3):

- _Permette (che mi presenti)? Vorrei presentarmi._ "Would you mind (that I present my self)? I'd like to introduce myself."
- _Molto lieto._ "Very pleased to meet you."
- _Arrivederci._ "Goodbye." (= _a + rivedere + ci_) More formal is _ArrivederLa_.

The more informal counterparts are (20.2, 20.3):

- _Mi chiamo..._ "My name is..."
- _Piacere!_ "Nice to meet you!"
- _Ciao!_ "Bye!"

_Auguri_ means "best wishes", used in virtually all situations including birthdays and Christmas, but not before exams, where on uses _In bocca al lupo! Crepi!_ (20.4)

Saying thank you: _grazie_, _molte grazie_, _grazie mille_, more formally, _ti ringrazio (a Paola)_, _La ringrazio (al Professore)_. (20.5)

Receiving thanks: _prego_, _di niente_, _non c'è di che_, _per carità - non è nulla_. (20.5)

Compliments: _complimenti_, more formally, _congratulazioni_. (20.6)

Making apologies using _Lei_: _(mi) scusi_. (20.7)

The simplest way to accept apologies is _prego_. One can also say _per carità_, _non si preoccupi_, _non fa niente_. (20.7)

Nowadays feminists tend to advocate creating feminine version of many titles for traditionally male-only or female-repulsive jobs, such as _poliziotta_ "policewoman" and _avvocatessa_, _soldatessa_, _vigilessa_ "traffic warden". However, the use of such titles remain perceived as ironical and patronising, far from the egalitarian purpose. (20.9)

As in English, the modal verbs used in the conditional make a request more polite, such as _potrei_ "I could" (22.1.1) _potrebbe_, _vorrei_ "I would" _vorrebbe_ "he/she would" (23.2.1), _saprebbe_ "would you know", also _direi_ "I would say" (24.2.4).

One feature that Italian shares with Spanish but not with French nor with English lies in sentences like "it is possible to...", where "to + infinitive" is the real subject (of the verb "is"). Or more often one considers "to" as a part of the English infinitive; similarly, in French, one says "il est possible de + infinitif". In Italian as well in Spanish, the infinitive form of a verb does not require more word such as _di/a_ than just the verb itself, so one says _è possibile + INFINITIVO_. (22.1.2)

A more formal or general request to express _È possibile...?_ is to use _Si può + INFINITIVO?_ (22.4.2)

A even more formal or polite request can be expressed by the verb _dispiacere_ "mind/disturb sb." (pres. ind. _dispiace_, cond. _dispiacerebbe_). (22.4.3)

Granting permission: use _pure_ "by all means" or _prego_ "please". (22.1.4)

Expressing wants: _volere_ (23.2.1), _aver voglia di_ (23.2.2), _sentirsela_ (23.2.4).

Expressing needs: impersonal verb _bisogna + INFINITIVO_ (impf. _bisognava_, fut. _bisognerà_, cond. _bisognerebbe_) (23.3.1), aver bisogno di (23.3.2), _c'è bisogno di + INFINITIVO_ (23.3.3), _dovere_ (23.3.4), impersonal verbs _servire a qualcuno_ or more formally _occorrere a qualcuno + INFINITIVO_, _è necessario_ + INFINITO (23.3.5).

The above _(di +) INFINITIVO_ can all be replaced by _che + CONGIUNTIVO_. Similarly in many other constructions not restricted to this context.

_Raccomandarsi_ is difficult to translate. Used by the parents of toddlers and teenagers throughout Italy, it means something like "If you don’t do what you’re told...", or else "I’m warning you" or "Listen to me", e.g. _Mi raccomando, non fate tardi!_ (24.1.3)

## Combining sentences

Common coordinating elements (30.2.2): _e_, _ma_, _anche_/pure, _inoltre_ "besides", _né_ "nor", _neanche/neppure_ "not even", _nonché_ "not to mention, let alone", _o/oppure_ "or"..

Marking contrasts (30.2.4): _bensì_ "but", _invece_ "on the other hand", _mentre_ "whereas", _però/tuttavia_, _piuttosto di/che_ "rather (than)".

_Anzi_ can mean "on the contrary" or "in fact". To affirm what has just been said, one has vocabulary _cioè_, _vale a dire_, _infatti_. (30.2.5)

Conclusion, consequence or results (30.2.6, 35.2): _allora_, _così_, _dunque_, _per cui_, _quindi_, _perciò_, _in questo modo_, _pertanto_; almost exclusively in spoken Italian is _ecco che..._ "and there you are, ...".

Causes and reasons: _grazie a_, _a causa di_, _per via di_ (34.2); _perché_/_ché_ (old fashioned), _dal momento che/poiché/giacché/siccome_ (spoken) "since", _considerato che_, _dato che_, _in quanto_ "inasmuch as", _per il fatto che_, _per il motivo che_, _visto che_ (34.3.1).

Expressing same time context (36.2): _quando_, _mentre_, _al tempo in cui_, _nel momento in cui_, _nel frattempo_ "meanwhile".

Expressing earlier time context (36.3): _prima (di/che)_. Note that _prima che + CONGIUNTIVO_, but does not require a suppletive "ne" as in French.

Expressing later time context (36.4): _dopo_, _poi_, _più tardi_, _appena_ "as soon as", _man mano (che)_ "gradually as", the apocopic form of _a mano a mano_.

Expressing time until when (36.5.2): _fino_, _finché (non)_, _fino a quando_. A verb in the subjunctive may be used in the clause if one wants to convey doubt as to whether the event or action will ever be complete.

Expressing a condition unlikely to be met or impossible, in the past time context (38.3.2), all three with the same meaning:

- _Se_ + pluperfect subjunctive, past conditional. (formal)
- _Se_ + imperfect, past conditional. (spoken, less formal)
- _Se_ + imperfect, imperfect. (more colloquial)

Expressing conditions with other conjunctions (38.4): _nel caso (che)_, _qualora_ "if (ever)", _posto che/ammesso che_ "given that", _a patto che/a condizione che_, _purché_ "provided that", _nell’eventualità che/nell’ipotesi che_ "in the event that", generally with subjunctive, and _anche se_ "even if", with indicative for possible situation and subjunctive for improbable condition.

The Italian "If only... !" is _se/magari + CONGIUNTIVO IMPERFETTO/TRAPASSATO_. (38.6)

Expressing reservation (39.2): _se non che/_eccetto che__ "except that", _fuorché_ "except", _a meno che (non)_ "unless", _tranne che_ "except, unless", _salvo (che)_ "save for, unless"

Expressing concession (39.3): _benché/sebbene_ "although", _nonostante/malgrado_ "despite (that), in spite of", _quantunque_ "however (much)", _per quanto_ "however", _con tutto che_ "with all that", generally with subjunctive, and _anche se_ "even if" with indicative or subjunctive depending on the possibility; _pur avendo/essendo_/per avere/essere "although having/being...".

## Formal (vs. informal)

Some spoken-only common expressions: _abbuffarsi_, _balla_, _faticare_, _fifa_, _fregare_, _stronzo_, _tele_, _OK_. (40.3.1)

In written Italian, _questo_ and _quello_ not only differ by literal meaning, but also express a preference. (40.4.3)

In conditional sentences in the past context, after _pensare_, _sperare_, _qualunque_, one usually use indicative in informal situation rather than subjunctive, which is the formal form (in the written language). A formality is expressed also by the use of _si passivante_ and _si impersonale_. (40.6)

The use of _Lei_ form: Although the foreign learner will be treated with a certain amount of tolerance, among Italians failure to use it is perceived as an omission of a sign of respect and a serious infringement of good manners.

One feature in which Italian is very different from English is that, Italian writers, especially in political commentary or in academic writing, feel the need to embellish simple structures and to construct a tissue of complex phrases. (42.4)

Far more than the British press, Italian newspapers, which were never intended for a mass market, make use of a coded language that can be difficult for even the Italian reader to access. This includes historical and literary references, understood only by an elite. There is also a foreign input of "codes", the foreign words especially English words. Many of these are now so much an accepted part of the language that they are barely regarded as foreign. Examples include _il ticket_ ‘voucher’ or ‘amount payable for healthcare costs’, _il budget_ ‘budget’, _il welfare_ as in _Ministero del Welfare_. Most foreign words are masculine in gender and have no distinct plural form. Some are used in a different sense from the English original, for example _il mobbing_ ‘bullying’ or _il footing_ ‘jogging’.. (42.9.4, 42.9.5)

## Others

Language habit: written Italian normally uses two _virgolette_ ("...") to open and close a quotation, sometimes a pair of _frecce_ («...») is used. (31.2)

An Italian suffix _\-evole_ "-able".

Si accomodi pure?
